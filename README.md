# Tooling for mblaze #

I make no advertisements for these scripts except: they are generally
short and do one thing.  Well...

They are my workflow on top of mblaze, which is pretty minimal.  I'm
not really happy with them, but I use them every day.

I think this says something about me but my hearing is going because
I'm old and I can't make out what the kids are saying.

Use at your own risk.  On a POSIX system.  Preferably OpenBSD.
